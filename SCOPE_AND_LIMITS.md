## 2. FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS

### No Legal Advice
The "AI Analysis" and "Chat" features are probabilistic tools based on Large Language Models (LLM). 
- **LIMITATION**: The system **DOES NOT** provide legal advice.
- **RESPONSIBILITY**: The user (lawyer) must verify all citations, deadlines, and interpretations generated by the AI.

### Single-Tenant / Role Simulation
- **LIMITATION**: This version (FREE/GAHENAX-GOLD) uses a "Role Simulation" model. There is no password-based login.
- **IMPLICATION**: Anyone with network access to the application can switch roles (Admin/Operator/Viewer) via the UI.
- **MITIGATION**: Use this software only on a trusted device or behind a secure VPN/Auth-Proxy.

### Local Storage
- **LIMITATION**: Files are stored on the local disk (`./storage`).
- **RISK**: If the disk fails, data is lost.
- **MITIGATION**: Users must configure their own backup solution (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox, or external drive).

### AI Hallucinations
- **LIMITATION**: The AI may generate plausible but incorrect information ("hallucinations").
- **RULE**: Never use AI output in court filings without human verification.
